        <p>A few years ago, we, the Genesis Force (the special unit of the AlphaSkullz), reached your 
          planet and began to infiltrate it. Your strength is rather poor, but you have developed something 
          that interests us: your virtual neural multiverse called "the Internet". It's possible to create 
          fantastic, crazy shit... virtually. No resources are needed and the possibilities are endless. We want to
          have that.<br/><br/>So we uploaded ourselves to the internet. Since you are not completely uninvolved in this internet, we offer some of you a unique chance. Join the glory AlphaSkullz and become part of an unprecedented alliance. Then you need not fear our strength.
          <br/><br/>We have decided to create 3,333 NFTs to simultaneously honor our Genesis Force. We want to see how great the will 
          of the humans is to become an AlphaSkull. If this will is great enough and all NFTs are occupied, an alliance between humans and
            AlphaSkullz will be formed. Sounds fantastic right? Join us and let's do great things!</p>
